# Game Theory -- Trees in Games
Many games can be solved using the minimax algorithm for exploring a tree and determining the best move from each position. 

## Basic Tree
Take a look at the game tree below. The circular nodes represent player positions and the lines represent possible actions. We have P1 acting first, P2 acting second, and the payoffs at the leaf nodes in the standard P1, P2 format.

The standard way to solve a tree like this is using **backward induction**, whereby we start with the leaves (i.e. the payoff nodes at the bottom) of the tree and see which decisions Player 2 will make at her decision nodes. 

Player 2's goal is to minimize the maximum payoff of Player 1, which in the zero-sum setting is equivalent to minimizing her own maximum loss or maximizing her own minimum payoff. This is equivalent to a Nash equilibrium in the zero-sum setting. 

She picks the right node on the left side (payoff -1 instead of -5) and the left node on the right side (payoff 3 instead of -6). 

These values are then propagated up the tree so from Player 1's perspective, the value of going left is 1 and of going right is -3. The other leaf nodes are not considered because Player 2 will never choose those. Player 1 then decides to play left to maximize his payoff.

We can see all possible payouts, where the rows are P1 actions and the columns are P2 actions after P1 actions (e.g. Left/Left means P1 chose Left and then P2 also chose Left).

| P1/P2  | Left/Left | Left/Right | Right/Left | Right/Right |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Left  | 5,-5  | 5,-5  | 1,-1  | 1,-1 |
| Right  | -3,3  | -3,3 | 6,-6  | 6,-6 |

Note that Player 1 choosing right *could* result in a higher payout if Player 2 also chose right, but a rational Player 2 would not do that, and so the algorithm requires maximizing one's minimum payoff, which means Player 1 must choose left. 

By working backwards from the end of a game, we can evaluate each possible sequence of moves and propagate the values up the game tree. Two main problems arise: 

### Problem 1: The Game is too Damn Large

In theory, we could use the minimax algorithm to solve games like chess. The problem is that the game and the space of possible actions is HUGE. It's not feasible to evaluate all possibilities. The first level of the tree would need to have every possible action and then the next level would have every possible action from each of those actions, and so on. Even checkers is very large, though smaller games like tic tac toe can be solved with minimax. More sophisticated methods and approximation techniques are used in practice for large games. 

### Problem 2: Perfect Information vs. Imperfect Information

What about poker? Real poker games like Texas Hold'em are very large and run into the same problem we have with games like chess, but in addition, poker is an **imperfect information game** and games like chess and tic tac toe are **perfect information games**. The distinction is that in poker there is hidden information -- each player's private cards. In perfect information games, all players see all of the information. 

With perfect information, each player knows exactly what node/state he is in in the game tree. With imperfect information, there is uncertainty about the state of the game because the other player's cards are unknown.

## Poker Tree

Below we show the game tree for 1-card poker. The top node is a chance node that "deals" the cards. To make it more readable, only 2 chance outcomes are shown, Player 1 dealt Q with Player 2 dealt J and Player 1 dealt Q with Player 2 dealt K. 

Player 1's initial action is to either bet or pass. If Player 1 bets, Player 2 can call or fold. If Player 1 passes, Player 2 can bet or pass. If Player 1 passed and Player 2 bet, then Player 1 can call or fold. 

Note the nodes that are circled and connected by a line. This means that they are in the same **information set**. An information set consists of equivalent states based on information known to that player. For example, Player 1 has a Q in both of the shown states, so his actions will be the same in both even though Player 2 could have either a K or J. All decisions must be made based only on information known to each player! However, these are actually different true game states.

![1-card poker game tree](./assets/section2/trees/infoset2.png)

Looking at the information set at the bottom where Player 1 passes and Player 2 bets, Player 1 has the same information in both cases, but calling when Player 2 has a J means winning 2 and calling when Player 2 has a K means losing 2. The payoffs are completely different! 

Therefore we can't simply propagate values up the tree as we can do in perfect information games. Later in the tutorial, we will discuss CFR, counterfactual regret minimization, which is a way to solve games like poker that can't be solved using minimax.

In imperfect info we need to know about the overall strategy

While we're mainly focused here on imperfect information games, we can take a short detour to look at Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as a way to deal with otherwise intractably large game trees. 

## Tic Tac Toe Python Implementations
This part is tangential from AI poker

### Tic Tac Toe in Python
Below we show a basic Python class called Tictactoe. The board is initialized with all 0's and each player is represented by a 1 or -1. Those numbers go into board spaces when the associated player makes a move. The class has 5 functions: 

1. make_move: Enters the player's move onto the board if the space is available and advances the play to the next player
2. new_state_with_move: Same as make_move, but returns a copy of the board with the new move instead of the original board
3. available_moves: Lists the moves that are currently available on the board
4. check_result: Checks every possible winning sequence and returns either the winning player's ID if there is a winner, a 0 if the game has ended in a tie, or None if the game is not over yet
5. repr: Used for printing the board. Empty slots are represented by their number from 0 to 8, player 1 is represented with 'x', player 2 is represented with 'o', and a line break is added as needed after the first 3 and middle 3 positions.

We also have two simple agent classes: 
1. HumanAgent: Enters a move from 0-8 and the move is placed if it's available, otherwise we ask for the move again
2. RandomAgent: Randomly selects a move from the available moves

Finally, we need another function to actually run the game.

We can apply the minimax algorithm to tic tac toe.
