AIVAT Variance Reduction
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.06915.pdf 

stuff from thesis 


AI vs. Humans – What Can Humans Learn? (Real events, themes in small games, simple strategies from toy games that can translate to full games, paper with Sam) - 14
Add random AI, ABC player, more advanced player (MDF, bluffing, slowplaying), RL with MDF or thing with Sam, etc. and play against
Some hand histories from big human vs. AI competitions, other AI hands how it would have played in interesting spots, preflop hand ranges/limping, bet sizing overbets/non-standardized bet sizing, when to bet continuation bets donk bets thin value bets, other topics raising the river perfect balance
Detailed statistics, distributions, hand histories, and “why”/when the AI agent does these things. Need hand histories from database (standard 1v1 games) and access to distribution of policy of AI agent. Potentially look at how play differs before fully trained and some situations % of each action and expectation after action and % of node searches, etc. through gradual tree expansion and how things change.
