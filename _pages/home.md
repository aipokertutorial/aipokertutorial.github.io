This tutorial is primarily targeted at people with a combined interest in math, coding, and poker who are interested in learning about AI through the lens of poker (and games in general).  A background in poker is not assumed -- I try to explain all of the terms and primarily use toy poker games with pretty basic rules. Coding is done almost entirely in Python. Math is mostly at around the algebra level. 

I hope to extend the tutorial with videos and more interactive content in the future. 

There may be some poker players who want to better understand how poker solving has evolved and how current solving algorithms and software work. I plan to create a very concise text (and/or video) for this audience category that is probably more interested in a summary and not all of the details. 

This tutorial is split into 6 sections: 
1. **Background:** Basic poker background and history of solving poker games
2. **Game Theory:** Foundations of game theory including trees in games
3. **Solving Poker:** What it means to solve poker and examples beginning with toy games
4. **Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR):** The core algorithm behind most recent poker solving
5. **Top Poker Agents:** Recent research and results with top poker agents
<!-- 6. **Other Topics:** Multiplayer games, other games, and decision making lessons -->
