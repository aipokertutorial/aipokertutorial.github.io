*Grinding (and not shaving) in 2009*

Welcome to the AI Poker Tutorial written by Max Chiswick!

I played high-volume online poker professionally until 2013, including playing 3 million cash game hands in 2009 and about 10 million hands overall. 

Then I studied AI poker for my master's degree, with a thesis on abstracting large games to small games to make them solvable. 

It's exciting for me to combine those two experiences into this tutorial where I hope to make AI Poker more accessible.
